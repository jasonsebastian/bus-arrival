A minimalist bus tracker app, written using Flutter. It will automatically determine the current nearest bus stop, and display all relevant bus arrivals for it.

Bus arrivals will auto-refresh every minute.

## Improvements

1. Add a new page to let user add/remove the relevant bus stops (along with relevant buses for it).
